# java_BST
An implementation of Binary Search Tree in Java using oop.

The prorgram is a exercise of implementing insert, remove and search methods recursively for a BST. 
BST extends an ADT BinaryTree class. BinaryTree is designed to have nodes - root, left and right. These do not conenect backwards. 

The main purpose of the program is to demonstrate the principle of BST algorithms. Its may not scale with large number of datapoints. 
I have tested with 10,000 random numbers to success.
